* **binary** (file) - the inputs that Reko decompiles. These typically consist of some form of machine
  code. 


* **Intermediate representation** (**IR**) - a low-level 

* **Machine code** - instructions directly executable by a computer. The 
  instructions are encoded in an architecture specific way. On some architectures,
  every instruction is encoded in units of the same size (e.g. bytes, 16-bit
  words, 32-words); on other architectures, instructions can be encoded using
  sequences varying numbers of these units.
