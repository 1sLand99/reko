## Reko.Core

The `Reko.Core` namespace contains components of the Reko decompiler toolchain that are architecture- and platform-neutral. Further information is available in the `README.md` files of various subdirectories


### Public API

The public "surface area" of the `Reko.Core` assembly is monitored in the `PublicAPI.Shipped.txt`
and `PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` files. Any changes in the surface area should be accompanied by
a semantic version number change, as described here: https://semver.org/

The instructions for how the Public API analyzer is used are located here: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/main/src/PublicApiAnalyzers/PublicApiAnalyzers.Help.md
