This directory contains samples of binary files obtained from the net. Each
subdirectory should contain a binary file and at least a README that explains
what is interesting about it. The outputs of running Reko on the binary are 
also stored. This is used for regression testing.

To run the regression tests on all the binaries in this tree execute the 
Python script
```
py regressionTests.py
```
